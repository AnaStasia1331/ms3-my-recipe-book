# My Recipe Book site 
My Recipe Book was built to demostrate my ability to design, develop and implement a back-end for a full-stack web application as well as to be able to manipulate data in non-relational database. The programming languages that were used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python.

# UX

## Who is this website for?
For users who want to record and store their recipes in an online cookbook.

## What it is that they want to achieve?
They need a simple way to write down new cooking recipes in an online recipe book, be able to find them, edit or delete.

## How does the project fulfil the usersâ€™ needs?
It provides an intuitive user interface for creation of new recipes. A recipe category can be assigned to a recipe that helps to search for it later, as each category lists all related recipes on a separate page. All recipes overview is also available to website users. They are able to view already existing recepies, modify and remove them.  

## Wireframes
The [wireframes](https://github.com/AnaStasia1331/ms3-my-recipe-book/tree/master/static/img/readme/my-recipe-book-wireframes.pdf) were created using Balsamiq tool.

## User Stories 
As a website user, I want to:

1. be able to create a new recipe.
2. be able to find an existing recipe based on the category/group it belongs to.
3. be able to access all recipes in a single place.
4. view the details of an existing recipe.
5. edit a recipe.
6. delete a recipe.
7. access the website from multiple devices of different sizes without major UI issues.

## Nice-to-have features 

1. Login functionality.
2. Image upload for a specific recipe.

# Database Schema 

MongoDB was used for storing data for the project.

## Major bugs discovered and fixed:
1. When triggering the delete recipe popup, for example, for the 3d recipe on the page, it showed the first recipe to remove. Fixed by passing {{ recipe._id }} into the delete popup.

## Known bugs:
1. On very big screen, the footer can display large width.

## Further Testing:

- [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate every HTML page of the project on syntax error. No issues have been detected.
- [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) service was used to validate css files. There are some warnings, 1 type of error known as an open defect https://github.com/w3c/css-validator/issues/305 in the validator
- Run the JS files through [Jshint](https://jshint.com/) linter, there are warnings but no major issues.
- [Python validator](http://pep8online.com/) warned about lines being too long.
- Dev tool in Google Chrome was used to check on console errors. 2 errors was fixed by removing the unused js code.
- testing of the README links was performed.

# Deployment

## Run the project locally

1. Open the repository in GitHub https://github.com/AnaStasia1331/ms3-my-recipe-book.
2. Find the Code button, choose the HTTPS clone option, copy the command.
3. Open a local directory where you want to clone the project to.
4. Open the Git Bash terminal in that directory.
5. Type the command 'git clone' plus the copied https url. 
6. After executing the command, the repository will be created in the local directory.
7. Make sure python is installed on your PC https://www.python.org/downloads/ and IDE has python extension.
8. Open the cloned project in your IDE, from the terminal install the dependencies listed in *requirements.txt*:
- for Windows:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- for Linux:    
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
9. Make an account on [MongoDb](https://mongodb.com/) and create the collections reflected in [Database Schema section](#database-schema).
10. Now switch back to IDE and create *env.py* file in the root directory. In the *env.py* type `import os`, then add enviroment variables taken from MongoDb:
```
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "mongodb+srv://<connection string >")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "<db name>")
```
11. To run the application use the command:
```
python app.py
```

## Heroku 
I've published my website using Heroku. To deploy a project, one should follow these steps:

1. As a prerequisite, your project must contain _requirements.txt_. Heroku uses that file to know what application and dependencies are required to run the app. To create _requirements.txt_ in the project run the command: 
```
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```
2. Next, create the _Procfile_ that specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup. Execute the command: 
```
echo web: python app.py > Procfile
```
3. On Heroku website https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps create a new app. The app must have a unique name.
4. In the _Deploy_ tab -> _App connected to GitHub_ section connect the Heroku app to your GitHub account.
5. In the _Settings_ tab -> _Config Vars_ click the _Reveal Config Vars_ button. Copy and save the key-value pairs that mentioned in the _env.py_ of your project.
6. In the _Deploy_ tab -> _Automatic deploys_ enable automatic deploys. 
7. To open the website from Heroku, click on the _Open app_ button.
