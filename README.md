# My Recipe Book site 
My Recipe Book was built to demostrate my ability to design, develop and implement a back-end for a full-stack web application as well as to be able to manipulate data in non-relational database. The programming languages that were used are HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python.

# UX

## Who is this website for?
For users who want to record and store their recipes in an online cookbook.

## What it is that they want to achieve?
They need a simple way to write down new cooking recipes in an online recipe book, be able to find them, edit or delete.

## How does the project fulfil the users’ needs?
It provides an intuitive user interface for creation of new recipes. A recipe category can be assigned to a recipe that helps to search for it later, as each category lists all related recipes on a separate page. All recipes overview is also available to website users. They are able to view already existing recepies, modify and remove them.  

## Wireframes (to edit)
The [wireframes](https://github.com/AnaStasia1331/ms3-my-recipe-book/tree/master/static/img/readme/my-recipe-book-wireframes.pdf) were created using Balsamiq tool.

## User Stories 
As a website user, I want to:

1. navigate throughout the website with intuitive web design;
2. be able to create a new recipe.
3. get confirmation my new recipe was saved successfully. 
4. be able to find an existing recipe based on category/group it belongs to.
5. be able to access all recipes in single place.
6. view the details of an existing recipe.
7. edit a recipe.
8. delete a recipe.
9. access the website from multiple devices of different sizes without major UI issues.
